title: "Apple fixes its new bagel emoji with cream cheese and a doughier consistency"
summary:
  "Apple’s most egregious crime in recent memory — a subpar bagel emoji — has been rectified, as first spotted by Jeremy Burge of Emojipedia. In the fourth beta release of iOS 12.1, it appears that the bagel has been replaced with a new icon that features both cream cheese and a doughier consistency more reminiscent of a fresh, hand-rolled bagel and not the frozen and machine-cut grocery store variety it was accused of emulating in its original form.
