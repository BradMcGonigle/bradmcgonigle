summary:
  "This is my Home Assistant Configuration created with the All In One installer expanded to 16GB. I update it pretty regularly. Home Assistant runs on my Raspberry Pi 3 with Aeon Labs Z Wave Stick (GEN 5). I've also added a 433Mhz Transmitter and receiver. The main SD Card was upgraded to 16GB."
