On the 30th anniversary of the original Nintendo Gameboy, the team at [Retroflag](https://www.retroflag.com) have announced an exciting homage to the 8-but handheld console. Like other Retroflag cases, this case takes a Raspberry Pi (a zero or zero w) but unlike this other cases, it includes all the components to easily build a portable retro gaming machine.

This thing looks great and Iâ€™m looking forward to getting my hands on one!
