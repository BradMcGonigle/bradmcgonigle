title: "Wait! Animate"
summary:
  "CSS doesn't provide an easy way to pause an animation before it loops around again. Yes, there's animation-delay but this simply denotes a delay at the very start of the animation, i.e on load. WAIT! Animate provides an easy way to calculate the keyframe percentages so that you can insert a delay between each animation iteration."

Delaying css animations on load sounds simple but is actually relatively complex, involving what can be the tedious calculations of keyframe percentages.

I've fought this doing this in the past and Wait! Animate seems like the tool to win avoid that fight.
