The *Internet* is abuzz with Tom Wheeler's, the current Chairman of the FCC, editorial [This Is How We Will Ensure Net Neutrality](http://www.wired.com/2015/02/fcc-chairman-wheeler-net-neutrality/) published to Wired today.

Speaking from experience, Chairmen Wheeler details the failure of his 1980s startup, NABU.

> [The] company was using new technology to deliver high-speed data to home computers over cable television lines. Across town Steve Case was starting what became AOL. NABU was delivering service at the then-blazing speed of 1.5 megabits per second—hundreds of times faster than Case’s company. . . .

> But NABU went broke while AOL became very successful. . . .

> While delivering better service, NABU had to depend on cable television operators granting access to their systems. Steve Case . . . had access to an unlimited number of customers nationwide who only had to attach a modem to their phone line to receive his service. The phone network was open whereas the cable networks were closed. *End of story*. [emphasis added]

We should all hope this is the beginning of a truely open internet.
