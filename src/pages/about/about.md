Hi, I'm Brad â€” a frontend developer and product designer from Orlando, Florida.

I've been working both as a product designer and frontend developer for over 10 years. I've been lucky enough to work with and for a wide variety of companies from large corporate environments to agency-style client driven shops to venture capital funded startups.

When I'm not creating things on the web, I spend my time with my wife Shaina and our kitty Mila.

I'm an avid surfer, hockey player and all-round sports fan. _Fly Eagles Fly!_

I like to pretend to be a chef with recent adventures into Sous Vide and smoking everything from meats to salt.
