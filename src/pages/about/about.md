I'm Brad McGonigle, a web developer and _sudo_-designer from Orlando, Florida.

When I'm not creating things on the web, I spend my time with my gorgeous wife Shaina. We have an awesome kitty, Mila, who shockingly likes to mostly sleep.  I'm an avid surfer, hockey player and all-round sports fan. _Fly Eagles Fly!_

I like to pretend to be a chef with recent adventures into Sous Vide and smoking everything from meats to salt.
