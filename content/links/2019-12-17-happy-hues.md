    Happy Hues - Curated colors in context.
summary: >-
    Red is a very emotionally & visually intense color that can actually have a physical effect on people by raising their metabolism, respiration, heart rate, as well as making them hungry. That combined by with the fact that red is very attention grabbing, you see red used in the branding of pretty much all fast food chains.

I love just about all of these color palettes which makes me think I should really get around to setting up proper theming for this site.
