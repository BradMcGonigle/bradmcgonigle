  Madefor: Wix’s Custom Typeface
summary: >-
  Madefor combines wide geometric proportions, clean curves, and flaring grotesk terminals as best seen in the flagship Display cut. The curvy, playful ‘s’ particularly shows off those features, while the pipe-bend short terminals of ‘f’, ‘j’, ‘t’ and ‘y,’ and the subtle asymmetry in the bowls of ‘b’, ‘d’, ‘g’, ‘p’, and ‘q’ showcase Madefor’s fresh and distinct appearance.
