  "For about a year, I worked exclusively on an iPad Pro. During that time I learned a lot about the highs (and massive lows) of iPad productivity, fell in love with the Apple Pencil, and discovered how best to balance my iPad and Mac lifestyle."

This is the most impressive review video I've ever seen. Serenity Caldwell created, edited and produced this video review completely on an the new iPad Apple announced during it's latest education event in Chicago. Even the music was created on the very iPad she is reviewing. The sheer creativity of this is awe-inspiring.
