    Using easing for more than just CSS transitions
summary: >-
    We can define easing curves for the transitions and animations on our websites to give them a more natural and subtle feel. But itâ€™s not just animations that benefit from easing curves. Any time there is a transition between two states an easing curve will make that feel more natural and less harsh.
