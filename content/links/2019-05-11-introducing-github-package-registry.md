    Introducing GitHub Package Registry
summary: >-
    Today, weâ€™re excited to introduce GitHub Package Registry, a package management service that makes it easy to publish public or private packages next to your source code. GitHub Package Registry is fully integrated with GitHub, so you can use the same search, browsing, and management tools to find and publish packages as you do for your repositories.
